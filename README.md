Blockchain basics
Blockchain is a digital database used to store information. Information is stored in groups called "chunks". Blockchain is a bit like an Excel spreadsheet. However, blockchain has some very special features that make it unique. Blockchain is:

1. Decentralization One of the many points you should discover in the process of learning how to become a blockchain developer is decentralization. The blockchain is not stored in one place - it has no center. It is stored on many different computers. These computers are called nodes.

Blockchain is called a peer-to-peer network because there are no third parties involved like Microsoft, Google, or Facebook.

Therefore, no one entity controls the data on the blockchain, and users and each blockchain developer transact directly rather than through a third party.
2. All information on the public blockchain is public. This means everyone can see it.

3. Guided by consensus This means that before new information is added to the blockchain, more than half of the nodes must agree that it is valid before it is added. It protects the blockchain from fraud.

4. Immutable This means that once information is added, it cannot be changed or deleted. Information on the blockchain is protected. This means it is encrypted and almost impossible to hack.

Software built on the blockchain are called dApps (decentralized applications). The first dApp was built on the Bitcoin blockchain and was a peer-to-peer payment system.

Other blockchains such as NEO, EOS, and Ethereum aim to achieve more functionality. These blockchains are designed to have various dApps built on them.

Bitcoin is designed to replace centralized banking. Platforms like NEO and Ethereum want their users to build dApp alternatives to various centralized applications such as Twitter, Google, and Uber.
